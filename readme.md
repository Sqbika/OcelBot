# Ocelbot
This is a bot I originally created for the Alice & Smith Discord server - now is a multipurpose private bot.

## Requirements
Requires Node.JS v8 or greater.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/artemisbot/Ocelbot.git
$ cd Ocelbot
$ npm install
```
You will also want to set up your API keys in the file `config.json`:
`outdated, will update eventually`
You can now run the bot by executing this:
```sh
$ node main.js
```
